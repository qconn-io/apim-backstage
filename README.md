# API Management Platform

An enterprise-grade, decoupled API Management Platform built with modern composable architecture principles. This platform provides comprehensive API lifecycle management through a modular, gateway-agnostic approach that separates concerns across control, data, and presentation planes.

## Overview

This platform implements a **three-plane architecture** designed for enterprise-scale API management with maximum flexibility and vendor independence:

- **Control Plane**: Backstage.io serves as the universal integration hub and single source of truth for API catalog management
- **Data Plane**: Pluggable API gateways (Kong, APISIX, etc.) handle runtime policy enforcement and traffic management
- **Presentation Plane**: Customizable partner portal built with Next.js and Strapi CMS for external developer experience

## Architecture Principles

- **Decoupled Architecture**: Independent control, data, and presentation layers communicating via well-defined APIs
- **Gateway Agnosticism**: Support for multiple API gateway technologies without vendor lock-in
- **Single Source of Truth**: Centralized API definitions, policies, and governance through Backstage catalog
- **API-as-Code**: Declarative configuration management with GitOps workflows and progressive delivery
- **Zero Trust Security**: Comprehensive security model with Open Policy Agent (OPA) for fine-grained authorization
- **Federated Identity**: Separate identity realms for internal developers and external partners

## Current State

### Architecture Overview

The platform follows a composable architecture pattern where each component can be independently developed, deployed, and scaled:

## Contributing

This project follows enterprise development practices:

1. **Architecture-First**: All changes must align with the documented solution architecture
2. **Documentation-Driven**: Update documentation before implementing features
3. **Security by Design**: Security considerations must be addressed in all components
4. **Test Coverage**: Comprehensive testing is required for all business logic
5. **GitOps Workflow**: All changes managed through Git-based workflows

## Security Considerations

- **Zero Trust Architecture**: No implicit trust between platform components
- **Federated Identity**: Strict separation between internal and external user identities
- **Policy as Code**: All authorization policies externalized to OPA
