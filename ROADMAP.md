Of course. Based on the consolidated feedback and the updated Solution Architecture (v3.0), I have produced a revised and more robust implementation roadmap.

This roadmap has been restructured to front-load critical enterprise capabilities, particularly in security and observability, ensuring that the platform is built on a resilient foundation from the outset. It translates the "what" of the architecture into an actionable "how" for the engineering team.

# **AI-Optimized Implementation Roadmap: The Decoupled API Management Platform (v2.0)**

## **Guidelines for the AI Development Agent**

*   **Follow this Document Sequentially:** The phases and epics are ordered by dependency. Do not proceed to a task until its prerequisites are met.
*   **Adhere to the Solution Architecture Document (SA v3.0):** This roadmap is the "how-to" guide for the "what" and "why" defined in the final SA document. Refer to it for schemas, contracts, and principles, especially regarding OPA, AsyncAPI, and observability.
*   **Scope Your Context:** When working on a task, focus your attention on the specified files and objectives.
*   **Use Placeholders for Secrets:** When generating configuration files, use placeholders like `{{ POSTGRES_PASSWORD }}`. Do not hardcode secrets.
*   **Write Testable Code:** For every backend feature, write corresponding unit or integration tests using Jest. For frontend components, use React Testing Library.
*   **Verify Each Step:** After completing a task, execute the specified `Verification` steps to confirm correctness.
*   **Ask for Clarification:** If a step is ambiguous, present the ambiguity and ask the human lead developer for a decision.

## **Phase 1: Foundation & Security Core**

**Objective:** To establish the core infrastructure, identity management, and a foundational Backstage instance, with security and governance tooling integrated from day one.

### **Epic 1: Core Infrastructure Setup**

*   **Task 1.1:**
    *   **Objective:** Create the Docker Compose configuration for all platform services.
    *   **Key Files to Create/Modify:** `docker-compose.yml`, `.env.example`, `.gitignore`.
    *   **Implementation Steps:**
        1.  Define services in `docker-compose.yml`: `postgres-backstage`, `postgres-strapi`, `keycloak`, `prometheus`, `grafana`, `loki`, `otel-collector`, **`opa`**, and `event-bus` (use Kafka).
        2.  Use healthchecks for all database and essential services to manage startup order.
        3.  Externalize all configuration into an `.env` file using variable substitution.
        4.  Create a comprehensive `.env.example` file.
        5.  Add `.env` to `.gitignore`.
    *   **Verification:** Run `docker-compose up -d`. All services, including `opa`, should start without crashing and report a `healthy` state.

### **Epic 2: Identity and Access Management**

*   **Task 2.1:**
    *   **Objective:** Configure Keycloak with separate realms for internal and partner identities.
    *   **Key Files to Create/Modify:** `/keycloak/realm-export.json`.
    *   **Implementation Steps:**
        1.  Log in to the Keycloak Admin Console.
        2.  Create the `internal` realm with clients for `backstage` and `grafana`.
        3.  Create the `partners` realm, enabling "User registration."
        4.  Export the realm configurations as a single JSON file for version control.
    *   **Verification:** Users can successfully log into the account consoles for both realms.

### **Epic 3: Backstage Scaffolding & Base Auth**

*   **Task 3.1:**
    *   **Objective:** Create a new Backstage application and configure it to use the `internal` Keycloak realm for authentication.
    *   **Key Files to Create/Modify:** `backstage/app-config.yaml`, `backstage/packages/backend/src/plugins/auth.ts`.
    *   **Implementation Steps:**
        1.  Run `npx @backstage/create-app` to scaffold a new Backstage app.
        2.  Modify `app-config.yaml` to connect to the `postgres-backstage` database.
        3.  Add and configure the Keycloak auth provider for the `internal` realm.
    *   **Verification:** Start Backstage. Users are redirected to the Keycloak login page and can authenticate successfully.

### **Epic 4: Foundational Governance Plugin (`catalog-validator-backend`)**

*   **Task 4.1:**
    *   **Objective:** Create a backend plugin that validates both `OpenAPI` and `AsyncAPI` specs against defined rulesets before they are ingested into the catalog.
    *   **Key Files to Create/Modify:** Create new plugin `catalog-validator-backend`. Modify `backstage/packages/backend/src/plugins/catalog.ts`.
    *   **Implementation Steps:**
        1.  Scaffold the `catalog-validator-backend` plugin.
        2.  Implement a `CatalogProcessor`. In the `preProcessEntity` step, check if `entity.kind === 'API'`.
        3.  **Conditionally validate:**
            *   If `entity.spec.type === 'openapi'`, use `@stoplight/spectral-core` with an OAS ruleset.
            *   If `entity.spec.type === 'asyncapi'`, use `@stoplight/spectral-core` with an AsyncAPI ruleset.
        4.  If validation fails, throw a `ProcessingError`.
        5.  Add the new processor to the catalog builder.
    *   **Verification:** Create two `API` entities: one with an invalid OpenAPI spec and one with an invalid AsyncAPI spec. Verify that catalog ingestion fails for both and logs appropriate errors.

## **Phase 2: Control Plane & Decoupled Authorization**

**Objective:** To activate Backstage as a control plane, build the gateway integration, and enforce fine-grained, decoupled authorization via OPA.

### **Epic 5: Gateway Controller & OPA Integration (`kong-controller-backend`)**

*   **Task 5.1:**
    *   **Objective:** Create a backend plugin that reconciles the state of `APIProduct` entities with the Kong Admin API and configures Kong to use OPA for authorization.
    *   **Key Files to Create/Modify:** Create new plugin `kong-controller-backend`.
    *   **Implementation Steps:**
        1.  Scaffold the `kong-controller-backend` plugin.
        2.  Implement a `processingLoop` that runs periodically.
        3.  **Step A (Data Fetching):** Fetch all `APIProduct` entities from the catalog and the current state from the Kong Admin API.
        4.  **Step B (Reconciliation):** Compare the desired state (Backstage) with the actual state (Kong). Create/update Kong Services and Routes based on the `gatewayConfig` spec.
        5.  **Step C (OPA Integration):** For each secured route, add the Kong `request-transformer` plugin to capture request details (method, path) and the `proxy-cache` plugin to forward the auth request to OPA. The Kong route should be configured to make an `auth_request` to the OPA service (`http://opa:8181/v1/data/http/authz`).
    *   **Verification:**
        1.  Add a new `APIProduct` to the catalog. Verify the corresponding Kong resources are created.
        2.  Make a request to the new route. Verify in Kong's logs that an authorization request is sent to OPA. The request should be denied by default.

### **Epic 6: Governance Workflow (`governance-backend`)**

*   **Task 6.1:**
    *   **Objective:** Implement the database and API for managing promotion requests between environments.
    *   **Key Files to Create/Modify:** Create new plugin `governance-backend`.
    *   **Implementation Steps:**
        1.  Scaffold the `governance-backend` plugin.
        2.  Using `knex`, create a migration for a `promotions` table (`id`, `source_ref`, `target_environment`, `status`, `requested_by`, `approved_by`).
        3.  Expose `POST /promotions` and `POST /promotions/{id}/approve` endpoints as defined in the SA. The `approve` endpoint must be protected by a permission check.
    *   **Verification:** Write Jest integration tests that call the endpoints and verify the database state changes correctly.

## **Phase 3: Partner Experience & Observability MVP**

**Objective:** To build a viable partner portal and demonstrate the platform's value by providing business-level observability.

### **Epic 7: Partner Self-Service API (`partner-management-backend`)**

*   **Task 7.1:**
    *   **Objective:** Implement the core API endpoints for partner self-service application and subscription management.
    *   **Key Files to Create/Modify:** Create new plugin `partner-management-backend`.
    *   **Implementation Steps:**
        1.  Scaffold the `partner-management-backend` plugin.
        2.  Create a database table for `partner_applications`.
        3.  Implement `POST /applications` to create an app owned by the authenticated partner (via JWT `sub`).
        4.  Implement `POST /applications/{appId}/subscriptions`. This will create a `consumer` in Kong and associate it with the correct ACL group for the subscribed plan.
    *   **Verification:** Use Postman with a valid partner JWT to call the endpoints and verify resource creation in the database and Kong.

### **Epic 8: Partner Portal MVP (`portal`)**

*   **Task 8.1:**
    *   **Objective:** Create a Next.js application for partner registration, login, and application management.
    *   **Key Files to Create/Modify:** Create new Next.js project in `/portal`.
    *   **Implementation Steps:**
        1.  Set up a new Next.js project.
        2.  Use `next-auth` to implement authentication against the `partners` Keycloak realm.
        3.  Create a protected `/dashboard` page where a partner can submit a form to call the `POST /api/partner/applications` endpoint.
    *   **Verification:** A new user can register, log in, and use the dashboard to create an application that appears on their dashboard.

### **Epic 9: Observability for Personas**

*   **Task 9.1:**
    *   **Objective:** Create initial persona-based dashboards in Grafana.
    *   **Key Files to Create/Modify:** `/grafana/dashboards/platform-health.json`, `/grafana/dashboards/api-product-kpis.json`.
    *   **Implementation Steps:**
        1.  Instrument the API Gateway to expose Prometheus metrics tagged by consumer, route, and upstream service.
        2.  Create a "Platform Health" dashboard in Grafana showing gateway latency, error rates (4xx, 5xx), and resource usage.
        3.  Create an "API Product Manager" dashboard showing request volume per API Product, top consumers, and traffic distribution.
        4.  Export these dashboards as JSON and provision them automatically.
    *   **Verification:** The dashboards load correctly in Grafana and populate with data as traffic flows through the gateway.

## **Phase 4: Enterprise Readiness & Advanced Workflows**

**Objective:** To implement the cross-cutting concerns for secure, resilient production operation and improve platform efficiency.

### **Epic 10: Platform Operator (Disaster Recovery)**

*   **Task 10.1:**
    *   **Objective:** Create an automation script for coordinated platform backup.
    *   **Key Files to Create/Modify:** `/operator/backup.sh`.
    *   **Implementation Steps:**
        1.  Create a bash script that executes `pg_dump` against the `postgres-backstage` and `postgres-strapi` databases.
        2.  The script will also trigger volume snapshots of Prometheus and Loki data stores.
        3.  It will then tarball, encrypt, and upload the backups to a secure, off-site location.
    *   **Verification:** The script runs successfully and creates an encrypted backup artifact. A restore procedure is documented and tested.

### **Epic 11: Advanced Deployment (Canary Releases)**

*   **Task 11.1:**
    *   **Objective:** Enhance the CI/CD pipeline and Gateway Controller to support automated canary releases for APIs.
    *   **Key Files to Create/Modify:** Modify `kong-controller-backend` and CI/CD pipeline definitions.
    *   **Implementation Steps:**
        1.  Update the `gateway-controller` to support a canary deployment strategy. When an API is promoted, it will initially configure the gateway to send a small percentage (e.g., 5%) of traffic to the new version.
        2.  The CI/CD pipeline's deployment job will, after the canary deployment, query Grafana/Prometheus for the error rate and latency of the new version.
        3.  If metrics are within acceptable thresholds for a set duration, the pipeline will call an endpoint on the controller to promote the release to 100%. If they fail, it will trigger a rollback.
    *   **Verification:** Deploy a new API version with a deliberate bug that increases latency. Verify that the CI/CD pipeline detects the anomaly and automatically rolls back the change.

### **Epic 12: Automated Catalog Management**

*   **Task 12.1:**
    *   **Objective:** Develop a custom Backstage entity provider to ingest API definitions directly from the gateway, reducing manual YAML maintenance.
    *   **Key Files to Create/Modify:** Create a new plugin `gateway-entity-provider`.
    *   **Implementation Steps:**
        1.  Scaffold the `gateway-entity-provider` backend plugin.
        2.  Implement an `EntityProvider` that connects to the Kong Admin API.
        3.  The provider will periodically fetch all services/routes from Kong and transform them into Backstage `API` entities.
        4.  It will use a unique annotation on the Kong service (e.g., `backstage.io/owner: team-a`) to assign ownership correctly in the catalog.
    *   **Verification:** Manually create a new service in Kong with the ownership annotation. Verify that a corresponding `API` entity appears in the Backstage catalog automatically without any manual YAML commits.
